well i founf a eccfet on internet now hwre image is stable and above imge thre is a symtric layout which is slowly rotating and other i can see image only through that layout and otherpart is hidden
ChatGPT said:
Ah, sounds like you found a CSS mask effect or hover filter where:

An image is placed as a background or base.

A symmetrical rotating shape (like a polygon or circle) is used as a mask or overlay.

The rotating shape acts as a window, revealing only the portion of the image underneath it, while the rest is hidden.

This kind of effect is typically achieved using CSS mask-composite, clip-path, or SVG masking, often with some JavaScript or CSS animations to rotate the mask.

Would you like me to help you:

Recreate this effect in code (HTML/CSS/JS)?

Or are you trying to implement something similar in your own project (e.g. Protekt Seals)?

If you can describe the shape (circle, hexagon, etc.) or share a link/screenshot, I can replicate the exact effect for you.

You said:
Recreate this effect in code (HTML/CSS/JS)?
ChatGPT said:

Answer in chat instead
I’ve created the rotating mask reveal effect for you in HTML/CSS. The image stays still, while a circular mask slowly rotates to reveal only part of the image in a spotlight-style. You can adjust the size, shape (e.g. hexagon, square), or speed if you'd like.

Want me to help turn this into a reusable component or tweak it to fit a specific layout or image?
