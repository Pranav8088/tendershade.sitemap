# Modern Timeline Component Migration Guide

## Overview

This document provides instructions for migrating from the existing timeline implementation to the new modern timeline component. The new implementation follows best practices for performance, accessibility, and responsive design.

## Files Created

1. **`timeline.html`** - The main HTML markup for the timeline component using semantic HTML5 and BEM methodology
2. **`css/modern-timeline.css`** - Modern CSS with variables, flexbox/grid layouts, and responsive design
3. **`js/modern-timeline.js`** - ES6+ JavaScript with Intersection Observer API for scroll animations
4. **`timeline-migration-guide.md`** - This migration guide

## Files to Delete/Replace

The following files can be deleted or replaced as they are no longer needed:

- `css/timeline.css` (replace with modern-timeline.css)
- `js/timeline.js` (replace with modern-timeline.js)
- `css/animated-timeline.css` (no longer needed)
- `css/integrated-timeline.css` (no longer needed)

## Integration Steps

1. **Add the new timeline component to your website:**
   - Include the HTML from `timeline.html` in your desired page
   - Ensure the CSS and JS files are properly linked

2. **Update any existing references:**
   - If any pages reference the old timeline files, update them to use the new files
   - Update any CSS class references to match the new BEM naming convention

3. **Test the implementation:**
   - Verify the timeline works correctly on all target devices and browsers
   - Check that the video background displays properly
   - Ensure all animations trigger correctly on scroll
